# This is a a prefilled template for `kwaak`
#
# Several assumptions and defaults have been filled in. For proper usage, please customize the values to your needs.
project_name = "{{ project_name }}"
language = "{{ language }}"

## Optional: Connect kwaak to tavily to enable it to search the web
#tavily_api_key = "env:TAVILY_API_KEY"

## Optional: Override the tool executor. Valid options are `local` and `docker`
## Since agents write code, running kwaak in a sandbox is highly recommended
#tool_executor = "docker"

## Commands the agent uses for tools
## Test and coverage are required. Kwaak expects coverage to run the tests as well and echo both the test and coverage results to stdout
## At the moment, the format of the output does not matter.
[commands]
# Example: test = "cargo test --no-fail-fast --color=never"
test = "REQUIRED"
# Example: coverage = "cargo tarpaulin --skip-clean --target-dir target/debug --engine llvm"
coverage = "REQUIRED"
## Optional: Lint and fix command. This command is run after each completion cycle, before committing the code.
## Recommended to use, as it avoids the LLM getting distracted by linting issues
# Example: lint_and_fix = "cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty --allow-staged && cargo fmt"

## Git and GitHub configuration
## Kwaak can create and update PRs on Github. When using the `docker` executor, a token is required, as otherwise the agent cannot interact with git
## The token is expected to have read and write access for git, and the ability to create and update pull requests.
[github]
owner = "{{ github.owner }}"
repository = "{{ github.repository }}"
main_branch = "{{ github.main_branch }}"
token = "env:KWAAK_GITHUB_TOKEN"

## Kwaak uses different LLMs for different tasks. As a rule of thumb, tasks that happen often (like indexing, summarizing) require a small, fast model
## and tasks that happen less often (like completion) can use a larger, more accurate model.
[llm.indexing]
api_key = "env:KWAAK_OPENAI_API_KEY"
provider = "OpenAI"
prompt_model = "gpt-4o-mini"

[llm.query]
api_key = "env:KWAAK_OPENAI_API_KEY"
provider = "OpenAI"
prompt_model = "gpt-4o"

[llm.embedding]
api_key = "env:KWAAK_OPENAI_API_KEY"
provider = "OpenAI"
embedding_model = "text-embedding-3-large"

## Docker configuration
## kwaak requires a Dockerfile for the tool execution environment.
## Besides the dependencies to run the code, there are several additional dependencies:
## - `git` for interacting with the codebase
## - `rg` (ripgrep) for searching the codebase
## - `fd` (fd) for effective file searching
##
## In the future, an executor is planned that does not have these dependencies, but for now, they are required.
##
## If your project already has a Dockerfile and you want to keep it clean, you can specify a different file to use.
[docker]
dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
