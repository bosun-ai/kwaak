//! This module implements a conversation summarizer
//!
//! The summarizer counts number of completions in an agent, and if the count surpasses a set
//! value, the conversation is summarized and a summary is added to the conversation.
//!
//! Often when there are many messages, the context window can get too large for the agent to
//! effectively complete. This summarizer helps to keep the context window small and steers the
//! agent towards a more focused solution.
//!
//! The agent completes messages since the last summary.

        # Goal
        Summarize the conversation up to this point
            
        ## Requirements
        * Only include the summary in your response and nothing else.
        * When mentioning files include the full path
        * Be very precise
        * If a previous solution did not work, include that in your response. If a reason was
            given, include that as well.
        * Include any previous summaries in your response
        * Be extra detailed on the last step taken
        * Provide clear instructions on how to proceed. If applicable, include the tools that
            should be used.
        * Identify the goal the user wanted to achieve and clearly restate it

        ## Available tools
        {available_tools}

        ## Format
        * Start your response with the following header '# Summary'
        * Phrase each bullet point as if talking about 'you'
        
        # Example format
        ```
        # Summary

        ## Previously you did
        * <concise summary of each step>
        * You tried to run the tests but they failed. Here is why <...>

        ## Since then you did
        * <Summary of steps since the last summary>

        ## Reflection
        <Concise reflection on the steps you took and why you took them>
        
        ## Suggested next steps
        1. <Suggested step>
        ```
