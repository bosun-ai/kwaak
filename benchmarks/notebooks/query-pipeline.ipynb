    "* Review and modify the generated initial answers to establish a ground truth\n",
    "* Make some changes to kwaak, run the eval step without recording ground truth, with the base file as input\n",

       "\"The context provides a wealth of information about Kwaak, but does not cover all high-level components or provide a mermaid diagram. Here's what I can provide based on the available context:\\n\\n### Overview of Kwaak\\n\\nKwaak is a tool that allows you to run a team of autonomous AI agents from your terminal. These agents can help write, execute, and improve code. It differentiates itself by focusing on utilizing autonomous agents to manage tasks like updating documentation or code quality, allowing the user to focus on higher priority tasks.\\n\\n### Key Features\\n\\n- **Autonomous Agents**: Agents can run multiple tasks autonomously.\\n- **Code Awareness**: Kwaak is aware of your codebase and can answer questions, write code, execute commands, and create pull requests.\\n- **Open-Source**: The tool is open-source and part of the bosun.ai project.\\n- **Backend and Frontend**: It includes a lightweight frontend built on top of Ratatui and a backend communicated through dispatched commands.\\n- **Safe Execution Environment**: Docker is used to provide a safe environment for executing the code.\\n\\n### Architecture\\n\\n1. **Frontend and Backend**: The frontend is Ratatui based and interacts with the backend via dispatched commands.\\n2. **Indexing**: On initial startup, it will index the codebase using Swiftide for RAG (retrieval-augmented generation).\\n3. **Session Management**: Supports multiple sessions in parallel, with each session running an instance of an agent in a Docker container.\\n4. **Command Handling**: Utilizes a command pattern to handle backend actions asynchronously.\\n\\nA diagram of the components based on this information would be valuable, but the provided context does not include a specific architecture diagram or detailed breakdown into components.\\n\\n### Further Leads\\n\\n- Refer to the `ARCHITECTURE.md` file for a deeper understanding of session and command management.\\n- Review the `README.md` for high-level features and operational details.\\n\\nUnfortunately, without more detailed context or a specific diagram already present, I cannot provide a mermaid diagram specifically detailing high-level components. Further exploration of the `./ARCHITECTURE.md` and the overall repository might provide the necessary details to create such a diagram.\""
