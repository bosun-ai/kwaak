    "ground_truths": "# How the Baseline System Processes Code Directories\n\nBased on the provided information, the baseline system processes code directories through the following steps:\n\n1. **Parsing Arguments**: The system takes two main arguments - a directory path and a question about the code.\n\n2. **Reading Directory Contents**: It uses the `read_directory_into_string` function to recursively read the entire directory, including all files and their contents, combining them into a single string representation.\n\n3. **Extracting Relevant Information**: The system then calls `get_relevant_information`, which:\n   - Takes the directory content string and the user's question\n   - Uses a language model (specifically the Gemini Flash model through the `generate_text_cheap_large_context` function) to identify and extract information relevant to answering the question\n\n4. **Generating an Answer**: The extracted relevant information and the original question are passed to the `answer_question` function, which:\n   - Uses a more powerful language model (Claude Sonnet through the `generate_text_large_model` function)\n   - Generates a comprehensive answer based on the relevant code information\n\n5. **Output Handling**: Finally, the system:\n   - Prints the output as JSON\n   - Saves the results to a file for future reference\n\nThis approach uses a two-stage process with different language models: first using a model optimized for handling large context (the entire codebase) to extract relevant portions, then using a more sophisticated model to generate the final answer based on that extracted information."
